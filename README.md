# DT-Task

This repository contains a decision tree machine learning task implemented in Python. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate a decision tree model for classification using a given dataset. It involves data preprocessing, model training, visualization, and performance evaluation.

## Objectives

- Perform data preprocessing and exploration
- Train a decision tree classifier
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualize the decision tree

## Features

- End-to-end workflow of a decision tree ML model
- Clean and well-commented code for easy understanding
- Visualization of decision boundaries and the decision tree structure
- Performance evaluation using sklearn metrics

## Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn for machine learning and evaluation
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for development

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sneha280904/DT-Task.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DT-Task
   ```

3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the code cells to see the full analysis and model output.

## Results

- The model successfully classifies data using decision tree logic
- Includes evaluation metrics for assessing prediction performance
- Visual tools help interpret how the decision tree makes predictions
